# Instructions
Please note that [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/ "You can install both with just the node.js installer") are required for this to work.

1. Clone or download the repository to your computer
2. Navigate to the project's directory in cmd (or any equivalent CLI)
3. Run `npm install`
4. Copy the SVG files to _src/pages_ (the files must be named _1.svg_, _2.svg_ etc.)
5. Run `npm run build`

It'll take a few minutes for the book to be built, after which it'll be available in the _build_ folder and can be read through _index.html_.
